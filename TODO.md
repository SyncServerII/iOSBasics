## Sign-in flow with an invitation.
I've not yet taken this into account with the new sign-in packages.

##  func completeSignInProcess(autoSignIn:Bool)
I've also not implemented this in the iOSFacebook package. It wasn't appropriate for this location.

I want to check if this exact piece of code has been repeated in the other sign-in packages.

Where should this go? In the SignInManager?
