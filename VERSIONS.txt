			`uploadExpiryDuration`.
		- Also added a test for new server support of detecting a duplicate v0 upload: 	
			.v0DuplicateFileUpload

Version 0.30.4 (8/1/21)
	* Fixed an issue (that an Apple reviewer found-- thank you Apple!) in `sendRequestTo` which, since the addition of refresh retries to refresh an expired access token, wasn't allowing requests to endpoints which didn't require authentication. And specifically, requests to `getSharingInvitationInfo` had no longer been working. And so when the Apple reviewer tried to redeem a sharing invitation, that failed because the request to `getSharingInvitationInfo` failed.
